# A Page That I rebuild for Robotics & IoT, HCMC, Vietnam 
### visit it at https://hcmusrobotics.netlify.app/
The club's current website: https://ailab.hcmus.edu.vn/riot.

This current website is only a sub-representation of the Club as a child of AI-LAB. I wanted to build a landing page for the Robotics & Iot Club, specifically to target kids and teenagers to participate in the club. The landing page contains only the basics of the club such as about, offers, and some contact information. 

## Tech Stack
I used React for this single page, with an aim to port it to Gatsby after I learned it (for efficiency). Also, I used SCSS and GSAP for the designs and animations.


## Design
I picked turquoise as my main theme and worked on from there. I believe turquoise can help creating a welcome and friendly environment so that clients get comfortable browsing the website. I also used flat design for simplicity. My main illustration is from https://storyset.com/.
